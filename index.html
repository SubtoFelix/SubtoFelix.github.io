    <!--In this assignment, I decided to create a website focus on the components of good comics and
    animations. I have always love reading comics, whether online or on paper, and watching animations.
    As a rookie artist, I love to assess the arts and animations in these stories; however, I also enjoy
    analyzing their storyline and worldbuilding. The themes of my website include the elements of great
    comics and animations and my experience of making a webcomic. Additionally, I added a form for the readers of
    this website to share their thoughts and a little biography about myself-->

            <!--Intro-->
            <p>
                Ever since I was very young, I have always love the adventure of the main character in a story filled
                with colourful settings and exciting plotline, whether in comics or animations. The way it brings out 
                our childhood dream and imagination to life is what makes them so magical.
            </p>

                Of course, many people love differnt kinds of stories and have their own opinions of what is considered
                "marvelous" and "terrible".
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I love watching and reading fantasy, mystery, and drama genres,but others might like romance
                and horror. Despite all that, there are some elements that can make an animation more captivating or a 
                comic that engages more with the readers.
            </p>
            <p class="important">Without further ado, let's dive straight into them!</p>

                    <p class="descript">
                        If you don't understand what the comic or animation is about, you will probably not want to
                        stick to them for too long. A confusing story will not attract any viewer. The flow of a
                        great comic or animation has to be smooth and easy for the viewers to follow so they know
                        what's going on.

                    <p class="descript">
                        One of the most important factors that readers consider in choosing a comic to read is
                        the arts. If the colours and drawings of a comic are aesthetically pleasing, readers
                        are more likely to read it. The same goes for animations, except now, sounds are involved:
                        if the colours and sound-effects convey a dramatic effect, the watchers will be more immersed
                        in the story.

                        Have your ever felt strong sympathy or hatred for a character, despite them being fictional?
                        Building characters that are unique and realistic will help foster connections between the viewers
                        and the characters. Giving them flaws and strengths, interesting goals and motivations, along with
                        hobbies and mannerisms will absorb the viewers into the story.

                    <p class="descript">
                        A must for every good story is a consistent storyline. A story with clear focus that doesn't deviate
                        from the main plot will keep the viewers engage and prevent them from getting comfused. Conflict and
                        Tension is also a must in keeping them at the edge of their seats.

                    <p class="descript">
                        A fascinating, novel, and consistent worldbuilding will not only keep your readers glue to the screen
                        (or paper), but also make your story stand out. Especially in a fantasy genre, the better the
                        worldbuilding, the more likely the stories will attract more viewers and make them stick to 
                        the stories.
