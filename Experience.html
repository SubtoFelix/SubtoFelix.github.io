                I first started with designing the chracters and outlining the story from the whole plot to each chapter's storyline. I then work on
                the drawing and colouring each page of the webcomic, which was not an easy task by any means. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish
                drawing my entire webcomic but it was certainly quite a learning experience for me.
